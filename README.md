## Adding Projects Without Direct Code Editing 🚀

One of the unique features of this portfolio is the ability to add projects without direct code modification or relying on a database. Here's how:

1. I use [npoint.io](https://www.npoint.io/) to store JSON data online.
2. By fetching the data from the provided link, the portfolio dynamically displays the projects.
3. This way, projects can be easily updated or added by simply updating the JSON data on npoint.io.
